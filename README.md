# Alphashort.ai
ASSIGNMENT 1:
Algorithm/Machine learning is used by alphashots.ai to predict the historical patterns.
Alphashots.ai likely uses a combination of time-series analysis models and machine learning algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are well-suited for identifying sequential patterns in historical data.
Alphashots.ai likely employs machine learning models like pattern-matching algorithms, coupled with AI-based time-series analysis techniques, for analyzing historical patterns in stock data. These models may use large datasets to identify trends and generate investment signals for specified holding periods. 
hese algorithms excel at capturing dependencies in time-series data, making them useful for financial market prediction. Additionally, Alphashots.ai may incorporate ensemble techniques to improve predictive accuracy by combining outputs from multiple models.
The AI likely uses methods such as LSTMs or RNNs, which are popular for sequential data and stock forecasting.
